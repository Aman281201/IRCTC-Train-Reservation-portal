### Background Info

1. One of the primary and most famous forms of transportation in today’s world is railways.

2. Some of the reasons for its popularity is the low cost, the comfort and quality of travel and less time taken for travel.

3. India alone has a railway network with about 22,000 trains and a daily passenger of approximately 24 millions. This shows that railways are extremely for people to travel and hence calls for a systematic and well maintained database for its upkeep and growth.

4. We have tried our level best to design a database which logically satisfies the need for a railway management system.

5. We have created a web application for our database which implements authentication and provides the users and the admin the best environment which suits their needs and helps them do their respective tasks.
